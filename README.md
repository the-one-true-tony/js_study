#Function, methods and constructor calls#
Functions are just functions

#Methods are object properties that happen to be functions#
Constructors are functions that become new objects (think classes).  Constructors can be utilized by calling a new instance of it

#High order functions#
high order functions are nothing more than functions that are passed in functions and return a function

#Bind, Call and Apply#
The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value
"A for array, C for comma"
Call and apply both function similarly like bind but call takes in many set arguments and apply takes in an array

#Arguments#
Arguments is a key word that returns all the arguments passed into an function.  This can be very useful for instance arguments.length

#Generator function#
Generator functions are functions that can return multiple values
